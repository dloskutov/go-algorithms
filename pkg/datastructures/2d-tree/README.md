# 2-d tree

In computer science, a **2-d tree** (short for 2-dimensional tree) is a space-partitioning data structure for organizing points in a 2-dimensional space. 2-d trees are a useful data structure for several applications, such as searches involving a 2-dimensional search key (e.g. range searches and nearest neighbor searches) and creating point clouds. 2-d trees are a special case of binary space partitioning trees.
