# Disjoint Set

In computer science, a **disjoint-set** data structure, also called a union–find data structure or merge–find set, is a data structure that stores a collection of disjoint (non-overlapping) sets. Equivalently, it stores a partition of a set into disjoint subsets. It provides operations for adding new sets, merging sets (replacing them by their union), and finding a representative member of a set. The last operation allows to find out efficiently if any two elements are in the same or different sets.
